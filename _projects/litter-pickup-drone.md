Developed as a capstone project of my undergraduate degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of British Columbia, this project involved the design and development of a semi-autonomous drone that can pick up litter from trails. It is currently ongoing.

The capstone team have considered a variety of pickup mechanisms, and the 3-pronged claw mechanism that I designed has been selected. Using a set of custom designed central worm gear and helical gears, this mechanism converts simple rotation input from a DC motor to opening/closing a claw. Inspired by a gripper mechanism by Festo, each of the TPU-printed prongs bend upon coming in contact with an object, allowing the claw to grip onto the object more securely.
