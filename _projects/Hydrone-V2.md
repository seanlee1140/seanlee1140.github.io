As the Aircraft sub-team lead of UBC UAS design team, I was responsible for the design and development of Hydrone V2, a quadcopter drone designed to carry payloads for urban firefighting and equipment delivery objectives for AEAC 2026 competition, as well as various other objectives for future competitions. 

## High-Level Design Overview
Hydrone V2's design incorporates a number of innovative upgrades from the previous aircrafts of UBC UAS, including quick-release spars, quick-release payload mounts, cushioned battery housing, and mounting platforms for electronics.
