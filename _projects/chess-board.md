This project is essentially a controller for a game of chess on chess.com; it is a physical board that is synchronised with an online game of chess on chess.com.

When a user makes a move on the physical board, the move is detected with a mesh of hall effect sensors and sent to the software that plays that move on chess.com. When the opponent makes a move on chess.com, the move is detected and sent to the software that plays that move on the physical board.
